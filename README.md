# Qvill

This repository is some kind of collection of code snippets that may become a replacement for the current text editor in ViUR.

- ViUR-related classes to standard text markup (from [ViUR vi, branch feature/textedit](https://github.com/viur-framework/vi/tree/feature/textedit/))
- Soft-line break (from [ViUR vi, branch embeddableBones](https://github.com/phorward/viur-vi/tree/embeddableBones, but all was initially borrowed from https://codepen.io/mackermedia/pen/gmNwZP)
- Some kind of lazy table support
  - Based on the work of https://github.com/GarrettGeorge/QuillTables, a working demo lives at http://phorward.info/temp/quilltables/body.html but this runs only with one global Quill instance named ``quill``
  - Quill table support as a core feature is discussed (here)[https://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues/117], but currently only with a few approaches from individual contributors, but no general solution.
  - Maybe a general support will come somewhere in future...
